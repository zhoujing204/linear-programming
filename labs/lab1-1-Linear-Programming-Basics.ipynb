    "## Linear Programming (LP) Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear program is an _optimization problem_ where we try to maximize or minimize an _objective_ subject to some _constraints_. Let's take a very simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Amy and George would like to split a cake between themselves. Here are the rules for their cake splitting.\n",
    "  - Amy would like to have at least one-third of the cake (or more).\n",
    "  - George would like to have at least one-fourth of the cake (or more).\n",
    "  - George cannot have more than half the cake (he is on a diet).\n",
    "  - Amy will donate $\\$10$ times her share of the cake to charity. \n",
    "    - For example, if Amy receives $0.35$ share of the cake, she will provide $\\$3.50$ to charity.\n",
    "  - George will donate $\\$20 $ times his share of the cake to charity.\n",
    "    - For example, if George receives $0.4$ share of the cake, he will donate $\\$8.00$ to charity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to find a way to split the full cake between Amy and George so that we maximize the money donated to charity while respecting the constraints above.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "Take a minute and think through the problem. \n",
    "What fraction of the cake would you give to Amy? \n",
    "How much cake does George get? \n",
    "How much money does the charity get?\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively this problem is easy to reason about: George pays a lot more than Amy. A greedy strategy is to give George as much cake as he can eat while respecting all the constraints. Following this, we conclude that the optimal solution is as follows:\n",
    "  - George gets half the cake, and \n",
    "  - Amy gets the remaining half. \n",
    "  \n",
    "We can check that this satisfies all the constraints. Furthermore, it is clear that this will also give us the maximum amount of money for charity: $\\$20 \\times 0.5 + \\$10 \\times 0.5 = \\$15$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an optimization problem.\n",
    " - Maximize objective: money given to charity.\n",
    " - Subject to Constraints:\n",
    "   - Constraint on Amy's share.\n",
    "   - Constraints on George's share.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it precise and mathematical, let $x$ denote Amy's share of the cake as a fraction of the entire cake and $y$ denote George's share as a fraction of the entire cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x,y$ are called the _decision variables_ for the problem. They represent real numbers and in this instance the fractions of cake given to Amy and George respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximize objective: $10 x + 20 y$ (this is the money charity will get)\n",
    "- Subject to constraints:\n",
    "  - $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, x + y \\leq 1$ ($x,y$ denote fractions of a cake).\n",
    "  - $x \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$ (Amy gets at least one-third)\n",
    "  - $y \\geq \\frac{1}{4}$ (George gets at least one-fourth)\n",
    "  - $y \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ (George is on a diet)\n",
    "\n",
    "We write it as the LP \n",
    "\n",

    "## Linear Program (Definition)\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear programming problem has real-valued decision variables $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{rclll}\n",
    "\\max & c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2  +\\cdots + c_n x_n & & &\\text{linear function of decision variables} \\\\ \n",

    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key points are : \n",
    "  - Decision variables take on real number values.\n",
    "  - The objective function is linear (we can multiply decision variables by some constant factors and add them)\n",
    "  - The constraints are linear inequalities: compare a linear function over decision variables with constants.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Linear Programming problems are very simple and even restrictive in scope. Nevertheless, they are one of the most widely used class of optimization problems and many algorithmic problems can be translated into a linear program. There are very efficient algorithms for solving LPs including the famous Simplex algorithm of Danzig and the interior point methods. We can solve LPs with millions of variables and constraints quite fast."

    "\n",
    "We can extend our definition of LP in a few trivial but useful ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Equality constraints: LPs can accomodate constraints of the form \n",
    "    $$ a_1 x_1 + \\cdots + a_n x_n = b$$\n",
    "    since an equality constraint of the form $f = 0$ is a combination of two inequality constraints $ f \\geq 0$ and  $f \\leq 0$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Minimization of objective instead of maximizing. If we wish to minimize an objective $c_1 x_1 + \\cdots + c_n x_n$, we may instead maximize its negation $- c_1 x_1 - c_2 x_2 - \\cdots - c_n x_n$ (just remember to flip the sign of your answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following \"extensions\" to linear programming are not allowed:\n",
    "  - Nonlinear objective functions or constraints will change the nature of the problem and they are no longer linear programs. Example: \n",
    "   $$ \\begin{array}{rlll}\n",
    "   \\max & x_1 x_2 - \\sin(x_1) + \\cos^2 (x_2) && \\text{non-linear objectives -- not allowed}\\\\ \n",
    "   \\mathsf{s.t.} & x_1 - x_2 & \\leq 5 \\\\ \n",
    "   & x_1 - x_2 x_3 & \\leq 4 & \\text{non-linear constraint -- not allowed} \n",
    "   \\end{array} $$\n",
    "  - The constraints are implicitly \"and\"-ed together. In other words, _all the constraints_ have to be satisfied. If you have two constraints where you want either one constraint to hold or another but not necessarily both, that changes the nature of the problem completely and it is no longer a linear program.\n",
    "  - The decision variables are real-numbers. They can take on values like $1.3331555$ or $\\pi$. If the decision variables can only take on whole number values, that changes the nature of the problem to something called an integer linear program that we will study next week. \n",
