    "## Approximations for MAX-SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by examining a very elegant approximation algorithm for the MAX-SAT problem.  The key idea here is to use a probabilistic argument initially but we will get rid of all randomness in the end (the technical term for this is called de-randomization) so that we are left with a purely _deterministic_ algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAX-SAT Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recall the MAX-SAT problem. It is a variant of the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) SAT problem. \n",
    "$\\newcommand\\true{\\mathit{true}} \\newcommand\\false{\\mathit{false}}$\n",
    "We have $n$ Boolean (propositional) variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ that can take on truth values of $\\true$ or $\\false$. A formula in CNF is given by a set of _clauses_ where each clause is the OR of some _literals_. Literals \n",
    "can be a variable itself $x_j$, or its negation (not), denoted as $\\overline{x_j}$. Let's start with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",

    "C_1:\\ (x_1 \\ \\lor\\ x_2\\ \\lor\\ \\overline{x_3}) \\\\ \n",

    "$x_j$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "How many clauses can we satisfy (make true) at the same time by setting each variable to one of $\\true$ or $\\false$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us set  $x_1: \\true,\\ x_2:\\ \\false,\\ x_3:\\ \\true,\\ x_4:\\ \\true, x_5:\\ \\true$. Notice that by doing so we can satisfy clauses $C_1, C_2, C_4$ and $C_5$ but not $C_3$. Can you find a truth assignment that satisfies all $5$ clauses?\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "The MAX-SAT problem asks given a set of variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and CNF clauses $C_1, \\ldots, C_m$ a truth assignment to $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ that satisfies the maximum number of clauses. I.e, no other truth assignment can satisfy a strictly greater number of clauses.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that MAX-SAT is NP-hard because if we can solve MAX-SAT efficiently, we can use our solution in a simple manner to check if a Boolean formula given as CNF is satisfiable. We know that CNF Satisfiability problem is NP-Complete.\n",

    "## Approximation Algorithm for MAX-3-SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newcommand\\opt{\\text{OPT}}$\n",
    "We will consider the special case of MAX-3-SAT when each clause has precisely three literals. Also assume that all the literals in a clause are distinct. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of $\\frac{8}{7}$. I.e, let us say that our approximation algorithm finds a satisfying assignment that satisfying $M_a$ clauses and let $\\opt$ be the actual optimum number of clauses (the maximum number that any assignment can satisfy). We have\n",
    "$$ \\frac{7}{8} \\opt \\leq M_g \\leq \\opt \\,.$$\n",
    "If you are noticing that this inequality seems different from what we saw from the vertex cover or job-shop scheduling problems, note that in those problems we were _minimizing_ an objective (the makespan or the size of the vertex cover). Here we are maximizing the number of satisfied clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now derive the approximation algorithm in two phases: \n",
    "  1. We will show that a random choice of $\\true/\\false$ for each variable will satisfy $7/8$ths of the clauses _on average_.\n",
    "  2. We will proceed to remove all randomness and force the algorithm to discover an \"above average\" truth assignment that is _guaranteed_ to satisfy at least $7/8$ths the total number of clauses in the problem. However, the $\\opt$ cannot exceed the total number of clauses in the first place. Therefore, the approximation ratio described above will follow.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Randomized Truth Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just say that we assign each variable $x_i$ to be $\\true$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\false$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, by tossing an unbiased coin. We assume that the toss for each variable $x_i$ is independent of previous tosses of the coin for the other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Q:__ What is the probability that a given clause $C_i$ is satisfied?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy to calculate.\n",
    "  - $C_i$ is a clause with three distinct literals by assumption (we are considering a MAX-3-CNF-SAT problem). \n",
    "  - If any of the literals are true then the whole clause is true. Put another way, the clause is false only if all the literals are false. \n",
    "  - The probability of each literal being $\\true/\\false$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n",
    "  - The probability that three such literals are all simultaneously false is $\\frac{1}{8}$ (multiply the probabilities due to the independent tosses assumption).  \n",
    "  - Therefore, the probability that the clause is true is $1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the calculation extends to the case when a clause has just two distinct literals in which case, the probability of being true is $\\frac{3}{4}$, or just one distinct literal which would provide the probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being satisfied. We may not encounter such clauses in the original problem but may do so as we build our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Q:__ If we randomly assigned the variables to $\\true/\\false$ as described above, what is the expected number of clauses satisfied?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X_r$ be a random variable that denotes number of clauses satisfied by a random truth assignment. Likewise, for each clause $C_i$, let random variable $X_i$ take the value $1$ if $C_i$ is satisfied and $0$ otherwise. Note that $X_i$ is the indicator variable for the _event_ that $C_i$ is satisfied by a random truth assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have $X_r = X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_m$. Therefore, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(X_r) & = \\mathbb{E}(X_1) + \\cdots + \\mathbb{E}(X_m) & \\leftarrow\\ \\text{linearity of expectation} \\\\\n",
    "& = \\mathbb{P}(C_1\\ \\text{is true}) + \\cdots + \\mathbb{P}(C_i\\ \\text{is true}) & \\leftarrow\\ \\text{expectation of an indicator random variable is just the probability that it equals 1} \\\\ \n",
    "& = \\frac{7}{8} m \\\\ \n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, on the average, if we randomly choose a truth assignment, we can expect _on the average_ that $7/8$ths of the clauses will be satisfied.  Think of the truth assignments as forming a population of individuals and for each truth assignment we have an associated number of clauses it satisfies. The average number for the _entire population_ is $7m/8$. It is easy to conclude that\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    There exists a truth assignment that satisfies at least $7m/8$ clauses.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we find this truth assignment systematically? Repeatedly trying a random assignment will not work. There is no guarantee that we get lucky. The trick is to _de-randomize_ our approach by removing all randomness from the choice of the truth assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### De-Randomized Approximation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to consider the variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, one at a time. Let's start with $x_1$. We can separately consider two cases by setting $x_1$ $\\true$ and $\\false$, respectively. For each case, when we plug in a truth value of $x_1$, the formula can be simplified. Suppose $x_1$ is set to $\\false$,\n",
    "  - Clauses where the literal $\\overline{x_1}$ appears are simplified to $\\true$ and treated as _satisfied_ clauses.\n",
    "  - For, the clauses where the literal $x_1$ appears, we substitute $\\false$ for $x_1$ and that simply results in the removal of the literal from the clause.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why does this algorithm work? Remember that the original formula $\\varphi$ is a 3-CNF formula with  no two literals in the same clause involving the same variable. We noted that the expected number of satisfied clauses is $\\frac{7}{8} m$. Let $\\varphi$ be the original formula over $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$ represent those obtained by setting $x_1$ to $\\true$ and $\\false$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi_1) +  \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi_2) $$\n",
    "The $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the equation above represents the probability of choosing $\\true$ or $\\false$ for $x_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can say that $ \\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi)  \\geq 7/8m$ then it must follow that for at least one of $\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2$, we have  $\\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi_j) \\geq 7/8m$ for $j = 1,2$. Choosing the one with larger expectation gives the property that the new formula also has expectation $\\geq 7/8m$. In fact, this becomes a fact during the main loop in the algorithm presented previously.\n",
    "At any step $i$, we have the property that $\\mathbb{E}( \\text{num clauses satisfied:}\\ \\varphi) \\geq 7m/8$. Therefore, in the final result, we have eliminated all variables and thus, the overall number of clauses satisfied must be atleast $7/8m$. The optimal algorithm cannot get more than $m$ clauses in the best case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our approximation ratio holds.\n",
